Troubleshooting
---------------

- If you get warnings saying "Output from SHOW ENGINE INNDOB STATUS
  was truncated" that means that a very large deadlock are causing the
  output to be truncated. The consequence is that data for many of the
  InnoDB related data sources will be missing. For solutions to this
  problem see
  http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2006/08/08/how-to-deliberately-cause-a-deadlock-in-mysql/
